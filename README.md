# 🛡️ eKYC System

Welcome to the eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) System! This project uses facial recognition, OCR, and database integration to automate identity verification. Streamlined and secure, it's built with Python and Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

---

## 🔰 Introduction

This project aims to provide a lightweight, secure, and automated way to perform KYC verification using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It integrates face verification (using DeepFace), OCR (using Tesseract), and stores results in a MySQL database. The application is built with Python and Streamlit for a responsive web-based interface.
